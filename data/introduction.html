            <p>Ubuntu MATE is an operating system -- the core software
            that runs your computer, similar to
            <a href="cmd://link?http://www.microsoft.com">
            <span class="fa fa-windows"></span> Microsoft's Windows</a>,
            <a href="cmd://link?http://www.apple.com">
            <span class="fa fa-apple"> </span> Apple's Mac OS X</a> and
            <a href="cmd://link?http://www.google.com/chrome">
            <span class="fa fa-chrome"></span> Google's Chrome OS</a>.

            Ubuntu MATE is distribution (variation) of
            GNU/Linux. A dependable, secure, capable, and modern computer
            system that rivals all others in popularity and actual use.</p>
            <p>Unlike other operating systems, Linux is a major one used:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>on most of the world's fastest and most powerful
                supercomputers</li>
              <li>on many of (if not most of) the computers that make up the
                backbone of Internet</li>
              <li>and on corporate servers that require stability and
                reliability</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Ubuntu MATE is a stable, easy-to-use operating system
            with a configurable desktop environment. It is ideal for
            those who want the most out of their computers and prefer a
            traditional desktop metaphor. With modest hardware
            requirements, it is suitable for modern desktops and
            laptops, micro computers (such as the Raspberry Pi 2) and
            older hardware alike.</p>

            <p>The operating system is more secure, and better
            supported than the operating system pre-installed on most
            home computer hardware today.</p>

            <p>Using Ubuntu MATE provides you with the freedom to run a
            complete, full-featured operating system, pre-configured
            with most, if not all, of the applications you will need
            for your daily computing, or to change anything about the
            way it looks, the way it works, or the applications it runs
            to suit your taste.</p>

            <img src="img/screenshots/desktop-freshinstall.jpg"/>

            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <p>Ubuntu MATE has a number of guiding objectives and goals:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Accessible to all, regardless of language and physical ability.</li>
              <li>Increase both Ubuntu and MATE Desktop user adoption.</li>
              <li>Ubuntu alternative for computers that aren't powerful enough to run a composited desktop.</li>
              <li>First choice Ubuntu platform for remote workstation solutions such as LTSP and X2Go.</li>
              <li>Recreate the halcyon days of Ubuntu for users who prefer a traditional desktop metaphor.</li>
              <li>Use themes and artwork similar to Ubuntu so that Ubuntu MATE is immediately familiar.</li>
              <li>When possible contribute to Debian so both the Debian and Ubuntu communities benefit.</li>
              <li>Software selection will favour functionality and stability over lightness and whimsy.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What is Ubuntu MATE?</h2>
            <h3>Ubuntu</h3>
            <img class="left" src="img/logos/ubuntu.png" alt="Ubuntu" height="100" width="100">
            <p><a href="cmd://link?http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> is
            one of, if not the, largest deployed <a
            href="cmd://link?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>
            based desktop operating systems in the world. Linux is at
            the heart of Ubuntu and makes it possible to create secure,
            powerful and versatile operating systems, such as Ubuntu
            and <a href="cmd://link?http://www.android.com/"> Android</a>.
            <span class="fa fa-android"></span> Android is now in the hands of
            billions of people around the world and it's also powered by Linux.</p>

            <p>Ubuntu is available in a number of different
            <em>flavours</em>, each coming with its own desktop
            environment. Ubuntu MATE takes the Ubuntu base operating
            system and adds the <a
            href="cmd://link?http://mate-desktop.org">MATE
            Desktop</a>.</p>

            <h3>MATE Desktop</h3>
            <p>Wikipedia says that <a
            href="cmd://link?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment">a
            Desktop Environment is</a>:</p>

            <blockquote>an implementation of the desktop metaphor made
            of a bundle of programs running on top of a computer
            operating system, which share a common graphical user
            interface (GUI). Desktop GUIs help the user to easily
            access and edit files.</blockquote>

            <img class="right" src="img/logos/mate.png" alt="MATE Desktop" height="100" width="100">
            <p>The MATE Desktop is one such implementation of a desktop
            environment and includes a file manager which can connect
            you to your local and networked files, a text editor,
            calculator, archive manager, image viewer, document viewer,
            system monitor and terminal. All of which are highly
            customisable and managed via a control centre.</p>

            <p>MATE Desktop provides an intuitive and attractive
            desktop environment using traditional metaphors, which
            means if you've ever used
            <a href="cmd://link?http://www.microsoft.com">
            <span class="fa fa-windows"></span> Microsoft
            Windows</a> or
            <a href="cmd://link?http://www.apple.com">
            <span class="fa fa-apple"> </span> Apple Mac OS X</a>,
            it will feel very familiar.</p>

            <p>The MATE Desktop has a rich history and is the
            continuation of the GNOME2 desktop, which was the default
            desktop environment on many Linux and Unix operating
            systems for over a decade. This means that MATE Desktop is
            tried, tested and very reliable.</p>

            <h3>Open Source</h3>
            <img class="left" src="img/logos/osi.png" alt="Open Source Initiative" height="150" width="150">
            <p>What Linux, Ubuntu and MATE Desktop all have in common
            is they are Open Source. Open source software is software
            that can be freely used, changed, and shared (in modified
            or unmodified form) by anyone. In a nutshell Ubuntu MATE is
            free, in the truest sense of the word.</p>

            <p>Although you will find some distributions (variations) of
            Linux for purchase, the vast majority are provided free of
            charge, like Ubuntu MATE. Open Source software is licensed
            in a way that allows anyone to give it away for free, no
            strings attached. For example, the licence gives any member
            of the user community the freedom to use Linux for any
            purpose, to distribute, modify, redistribute, or even sell
            the operating system. If you do modify and then
            redistribute Linux with your modifications, you are
            required by the licence to submit your modifications for
            possible inclusion into future versions. There is no
            guarantee that this will ever happen, but if you have made
            it better, then your changes just might be included in the
            next release of Ubuntu MATE.</p>

            <p>Many of the users of Linux are corporations that
            use the operating system to run their businesses, or
            include it within their products. Many of these
            corporations provide fixes and new features for Linux as
            they use the software for their businesses. <a
            href="cmd://link?http://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/infographics/who-writes-linux-2015">These
            improvements are given back</a> to the Linux community and
            Ubuntu MATE improves as a result. This is how we can
            continually improve and grow without having to charge our
            users money.</p>

            <p>Unlike Windows, and OS X,&nbsp; Linux is not created and
            supported by just one company. It is supported by Intel,
            Redhat, Linaro, Samsung, IBM, SUSE, Texas Instruments,
            Google, Canonical, Oracle, AMD, and Microsoft. Over 4,000
            developers contributed to Linux over the last 15 years.</p>

            <p>Whether you are a home user of Ubuntu MATE, an Ubuntu
            MATE software or application developer, or an employee of
            an organisation that uses the operating system, you are a
            member of the Linux and Open Source communities and benefit
            from the efforts of the developers who contribute to Ubuntu
            MATE and its related projects, Linux, MATE, and
            Ubuntu.&nbsp; Members of the community can and do run Linux
            on almost any hardware, from the prettiest Macbook to the
            cheapest netbook, from the newest Chromebook to some very
            old machines designed for Windows, and from the most
            powerful Internet servers to the smallest smart
            thermostat.</p>
