            <p>Ubuntu MATE is an operating system -- software that runs
            your computer, like <a
            href="cmd://link?http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft's
            Windows</a>, <a
            href="cmd://link?http://www.apple.com">Apple's Mac&nbsp;
            OSX</a> or <a
            href="cmd://link?http://www.google.com/chrome">Google's
            ChromeOS</a>. Ubuntu MATE is distribution (version) of
            Linux, a dependable, secure, capable, and modern computer
            system that rivals all others in popularity and actual use.
            </p>
            <p>Unlike those other three, Linux is a major operating
            system that is used:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>on most of the world's fastest and most powerful
              supercomputers</li>
              <li>on many of (if not most of) the computers that make up the
              backbone of Internet</li>
              <li>and on corporate servers that require stability and
              reliability</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Ubuntu MATE is a stable, easy-to-use operating system
            with a configurable desktop environment. It is ideal for
            those who want the most out of their computers and prefer a
            traditional desktop metaphor. With modest hardware
            requirements, it is suitable for modern desktops and
            laptops, micro computers (such as the Raspberry Pi 2) and
            older hardware alike.</p>
            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <p>Ubuntu MATE has a number of guiding objectives and goals:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Accessible to all, regardless of language and physical
                ability.</li>
              <li>Increase both Ubuntu and MATE Desktop user adoption.</li>
              <li>Ubuntu alternative for computers that aren't powerful enough
                to run a composited desktop.</li>
              <li>First choice Ubuntu platform for remote workstation solutions
                such as LTSP and X2Go.</li>
              <li>Recreate the halcyon days of Ubuntu for users who prefer a
                traditional desktop metaphor.</li>
              <li>Use themes and artwork similar to Ubuntu so that Ubuntu MATE
                is immediately familiar.</li>
              <li>When possible contribute to Debian so both the Debian and
                Ubuntu communities benefit.</li>
              <li>Software selection will favour functionality and stability
                over lightness and whimsy.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>What is Ubuntu MATE?</h2>
            <p>If you are new to Ubuntu MATE, or only casually
            acquainted with Linux based distributions, it can be
            difficult to understand how a Linux operating system
            compares with other computer systems that you may already
            be familiar with. Hopefully this page with help demystify
            Ubuntu MATE for new-comers.</p>
            <h3>Ubuntu</h3>
            <img class="left" src="img/logos/ubuntu.png" alt="Ubuntu" height="100" width="100" />
            <p><a href="cmd://link?http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> is
            one of, if not the, largest deployed <a
            href="cmd://link?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>
            based desktop operating systems in the world. Linux is at
            the heart of Ubuntu and makes it possible to create secure,
            powerful and versatile operating systems, such as Ubuntu
            and <a
            href="cmd://link?http://www.android.com/">Android</a>.
            Android is now in the hands of billions of people around
            the world and it's also powered by Linux.</p>
            <p>Ubuntu is available in a number of different
            <em>flavours</em>, each coming with its own desktop
            environment. Ubuntu MATE takes the Ubuntu base operating
            system and adds the <a
            href="cmd://link?http://mate-desktop.org">MATE
            Desktop</a>.</p>
            <h3>MATE Desktop</h3>
            <p>Wikipedia says that <a
            href="cmd://link?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment">a
            Desktop Environment is</a>:</p>

            <blockquote>an implementation of the desktop metaphor made
            of a bundle of programs running on top of a computer
            operating system, which share a common graphical user
            interface (GUI). Desktop GUIs help the user to easily
            access and edit files. </blockquote>

            <img class="right" src="img/logos/mate.png" alt="MATE Desktop" height="100" width="100" />
            <p>The MATE Desktop is one such implementation of a desktop
            environment and includes a file manager which can connect
            you to your local and networked files, a text editor,
            calculator, archive manager, image viewer, document viewer,
            system monitor and terminal. All of which are highly
            customisable and managed via a control centre.</p>

            <p>MATE Desktop provides an intuitive and attractive
            desktop environment using traditional metaphors, which
            means if you've ever used <a
            href="cmd://link?http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft
            Windows</a> or <a
            href="cmd://link?http://www.apple.com">Apple Mac OS</a>, it
            will feel very familiar.</p>

            <p>The MATE Desktop has a rich history and is the
            continuation of the GNOME2 desktop, which was the default
            desktop environment on many Linux and Unix operating
            systems for over a decade. This means that MATE Desktop is
            tried, tested and very reliable.</p>

            <h3>Open Source</h3>
            <img class="left" src="./img/logos/osi.png" alt="Open Source Initiative"
                height="150" width="150" />
            <p>What Linux, Ubuntu and MATE Desktop all have in common
            is they are Open Source. Open source software is software
            that can be freely used, changed, and shared (in modified
            or unmodified form) by anyone.</p>
            <p>In a nutshell Ubuntu MATE is free, in the truest sense
            of the word.</p>
