          <p>Ubuntu MATE is a stable, easy-to-use operating system with
          a configurable desktop environment. Ideal for those who want
          the most out of their computers and prefer a traditional
          desktop metaphor. With modest hardware requirements it is
          suitable for modern desktops and laptops, micro computers
          and older hardware alike.</p>
          <h2>Objectives</h2>
          <p>Ubuntu MATE has a number of guiding objectives and goals.</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Accessible to all, regardless of language and physical ability.</li>
          <li>Increase both Ubuntu and MATE Desktop user adoption.</li>
          <li>Ubuntu alternative for computers that aren't powerful enough to run a composited desktop.</li>
          <li>First choice Ubuntu platform for remote workstation solutions such as LTSP and X2Go.</li>
          <li>Recreate the halcyon days of Ubuntu for users who prefer a traditional desktop metaphor.</li>
          <li>Use themes and artwork similar to Ubuntu so that Ubuntu MATE is immediately familiar.</li>
          <li>When possible contribute to Debian so both the Debian and Ubuntu communities benefit.</li>
          <li>Software selection will favour functionality and stability over lightness and whimsy.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>What is Ubuntu MATE</h2>
          <p>If you are new to Ubuntu MATE, or only casually acquainted 
          with Linux based distributions, it can be difficult to 
          understand how a Linux operating system compares with other 
          computer systems that you may already be familiar with. 
          Hopefully this page with help demystify Ubuntu MATE for new 
          comers.</p>
          <h3>Ubuntu</h3>
          <p>Ubuntu is one of, if not the, largest deployed Linux based
          desktop operating systems in the world. Linux is at the heart
          of Ubuntu and makes it possible to create secure, powerful and
          versatile operating systems, such as Ubuntu and Android.
          Android is now in the hands of billions of people around the
          world and it's also powered by Linux.</p>
          <p>Ubuntu is available in a number of different <em>"flavours"</em>,
          each coming with its own desktop environment. Ubuntu MATE
          takes the Ubuntu base operating system and adds the MATE
          Desktop.</p>
          <h3>MATE Desktop</h3>
          <p>Wikipedia says that a Desktop Environment is:</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>an implementation of the desktop metaphor made of a bundle
          of programs running on top of a computer operating system,
          which share a common graphical user interface (GUI). Desktop
          GUIs help the user to easily access and edit files.</p> 
          </blockquote>
          <p>The MATE Desktop is one such implementation of a desktop 
          environment and includes a file manager which can connect you 
          to your local and networked files, a text editor, calculator, 
          archive manager, image viewer, document viewer, system 
          monitor and terminal. All of which are highly customisable 
          and managed via a control centre.</p>
          <p>MATE Desktop provides an intuitive and attractive desktop 
          environment using traditional metaphors, which means if 
          you've ever used Microsoft Windows or Apple Mac OS it will 
          feel very familiar.</p>
          <p>The MATE Desktop has a rich history and is the 
          continuation of the GNOME2 desktop, which was the default 
          desktop environment on many Linux and Unix operating systems 
          for over a decade. This means that MATE Desktop is tried, 
          tested and very reliable.</p>
          <h3>Open Source</h3>
          <p>What Linux, Ubuntu and MATE Desktop all have in common is 
          they are Open Source. Open source software is software that 
          can be freely used, changed, and shared (in modified or 
          unmodified form) by anyone.</p> <p>In a nut shell Ubuntu MATE 
          is free, in the truest sense of the word.</p>
