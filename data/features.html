          <h3>Powerful Applications</h3>
          <p>While MATE Desktop provides the essential user interfaces 
          to control and use a computer, Ubuntu MATE adds a collection 
          of additional applications to turn your computer into a truly 
          powerful workstation.</p>
          <h4>Productivity</h4>

          <h4>Entertainment</h4>          
          <p><img class="left" src="img/applications/rhythmbox.png" /></p>
          <p>Rhythmbox is a very easy to use music playing and 
          management program which supports a wide range of audio 
          formats (including mp3 and ogg). Originally inspired by

          support, Audio CD burning, Audio CD playback, music sharing, 
          and Podcasts.</p>
          <hr class="soften" />
          
          <p><img class="left" src="img/applications/shotwell.png" /></p>
          <p>Shotwell is a digital photo organizer. It allows you to

          different image formats, also including raw CR2 files.</p>

          streams from various network sources.</p>
          <p>VLC can also be used as a streaming server that duplicates 
          the stream it reads and multicasts them through the network 
          to other clients, or serves them through HTTP.</p>
          <p>VLC has support for on-the-fly transcoding of audio and 
          video formats, either for broadcasting purposes or for movie 
          format transformations.</p>

          <h4>...and a whole lot more</h4>
          <p>Naturally you'll also find a firewall, backup application, 
          document/photo scanner and printer management all included in 
          Ubuntu MATE. And this is just the start. The <a 
          href="cmd://run?software-center">Ubuntu Software Centre</a> 
          includes thousands of applications suitable for just about 
          any professional or recreational pursuit.</p>

          <h3>Games</h3>
          <p><img class="left" src="img/applications/steam.png" /></p>
          <p>In the last couple of years Linux has become a first class
          gaming platform thanks to <a href="cmd://link?http://www.valvesoftware.com/">Valve</a>
          bringing the <a href="cmd://link?http://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a>
          platform to Linux. At the time of writing Steam has more than
          1000 high quality indie and <i>AAA</i> titles available for Linux.
          Ubuntu MATE is fully compatible with Steam for Linux.</p>
          <p>While Steam is a major step forward for gaming on Linux 
          there are also many high quality and enjoyable Open Source 
          games titles available for Ubuntu MATE via the Ubuntu 
          Software Centre. It doesn't matter if you like flight 
          simulators, motor racing, first person shooters, jump and run 
          or card games you'll find something to keep you 
          entertained.</p>

          <h3>Accessibility</h3>
          <p><img class="left" src="img/logos/a11y.png" alt="Accessibility" width="64" height="64"></p>
          <p>Making an accessible operating system was a key priority 
          when the Ubuntu MATE founders initially set out the goals of 
          the project. </p>
          <p>Ubuntu MATE is never going to be able to offer the 
          comprehensive integration of assistive technologies that <a 
          href="cmd://link?http://sonargnulinux.com/">Sonar 
          GNU/Linux</a> provides. But Ubuntu MATE will continue to follow
          their lead so that Ubuntu MATE is a viable desktop solution
          where computer access is shared within a household or business 
          where individual needs differ.</p>
          
          <h3>Mobile Integration</h3>
          <p>Currently Ubuntu MATE has the essential mobile device 
          support you'd expect. You can plug in a phone, media player 
          or digital camera and the device is automatically detected 
          and mounted, you can then access the files on it or sync 
          content.</p>
