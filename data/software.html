          <p><b>Zim</b> is a graphical text editor used to maintain a 
          collection of wiki pages. Each page can contain links to 
          other pages, simple formatting and inline images. Pages are 
          stored in a folder structure, like in an outliner, and can 
          have attachments. Creating a new page is as easy as linking 
          to a nonexistent page. All data is stored in plain text files 
          with wiki formatting. Various plugins provide additional 
          functionality, like a task list manager, an equation editor, 
          a tray icon, and support for version control. Zim can be used 
          to: Keep an archive of notes, Take notes during meetings or 
          lectures, Organize task lists, Draft blog entries and emails,

		  <p><b>Darktable</b> is a virtual lighttable and darkroom for

		  database and lets you view them  through a zoomable 
		  lighttable. it also enables you to develop raw images and 
		  enhance them.  It tries to fill the gap between the many 
		  excellent existing free raw converters and image management 
		  tools (such as ufraw or f-spot). The user interface is built 
		  around efficient caching of image metadata and mipmaps, all 
		  stored in a database. the user will always be able to 
		  interact, even if the full resolution image is not yet 
		  loaded.  All editing is fully non-destructive and only 
		  operates on cached image buffers for display. the full image 
		  is only converted during export. High-dynamic range, and standard
		  image formats such as jpeg are also supported. The core operates 
		  completely on floating point values, so darktable can not 
		  only be used for photography but also for scientifically 
		  acquired images or output of renderers (high dynamic 
		  range).</p>
